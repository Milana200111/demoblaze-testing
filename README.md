# Test Strategy ‚Äì Demoblaze Web Application

## Objective
To validate the **functional, API, performance, and usability** aspects of the [Demoblaze](https://www.demoblaze.com/) web application ‚Äî ensuring all major workflows like **Signup, Login, Add to Cart, and Checkout** function correctly across environments.

---

## Scope

**In-Scope**
- Functional testing using Selenium (Python)
- API testing via Postman
- Manual test coverage for UI and validation
- Performance testing using Locust
- Mobile responsiveness and accessibility testing

**Out-of-Scope**
- Backend database verification
- Payment gateway integration
- Email/SMS notifications

---

## Test Approach

### 1. **Automation Testing (Selenium + Python)**
- Covers end-to-end user journey: **Signup ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Product Selection ‚Üí Checkout**
- Uses Faker for random user data
- Captures screenshot after successful checkout
- Includes alert handling, explicit waits, and dynamic element handling

### 2. **API Testing (Postman)**
- API tests executed in **Postman**, verifying key endpoints:
  - `POST /view` ‚Üí Fetch all products  
  - `POST /viewitem` ‚Üí Get details of a single product  
  - `POST /addtocart` ‚Üí Add selected product to cart  
  - `POST /deleteitem` ‚Üí Remove a specific product from cart  
  - `POST /deletecart` ‚Üí Clear cart after checkout  
- Tested for positive, negative, and boundary cases  
- Assertions included for response status, body, and message structure

### 3. **Manual Testing**
- Conducted using detailed Excel sheets
- Focused on UI validation, field behavior, and boundary testing
- Includes positive, negative, and exploratory test cases

### 4. **Performance Testing (Locust)**
- Simulated user load of 10‚Äì20 concurrent users
- Measured:
  - Average response time  
  - Requests per second (RPS)  
  - Failure rate  
- Target: Stable response and no API errors under moderate load

### 5. **Mobile Testing**
- Tested on Chrome DevTools for responsiveness
- Verified layout, navigation, and usability on various resolutions
- Checked accessibility features (font scaling, TalkBack, color contrast)
